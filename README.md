## Assignment 8: Project Development and Feature Implementation

This document summarizes the work completed this week, focusing on content expansion, application flow, and the implementation of dynamic content rendering.

---

### Key Accomplishments and New Features

* **Visual Optimization:** I implemented overall visual improvements and optimization across the project for a better user experience.
* **Situational Practice Expansion:**
    * I successfully added the **second chapter** to the practice section.
    * The **feedback content and logic** were finalized, ensuring the user receives the appropriate response after completing either chapter.
* **Dynamic Learning Resources:** I used **JavaScript** (`script.js`) to dynamically update and manage the list of book resources, retrieving content from a centralized data array.

### Implementation Notes

* **Chapter Flow:** Both Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 now correctly redirect to `feedback.html` upon completion, displaying a unified grade based on the scenario outcome(s).
* **Dynamic Content:** The structure and styling for the resources page are now managed through JavaScript elements created from the data array, as required by the assignment.

### Challenges and Learning

* **Code Difficulty:** Coding remains a significant challenge for me. Although the project's overall presentation is now good, I still rely heavily on extensive AI assistance.
* **Specific Confusion:** While I can generally understand the **HTML structure** with the aid of AI, the **CSS** (styling logic) and **JavaScript** (functional logic) sections remain highly confusing and require further dedicated learning.
